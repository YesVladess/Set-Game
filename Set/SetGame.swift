///
/// The object of the game is to identify a 'set' of three cards from 12 cards laid out on the
/// table. Each card has a variation of the following four features:
///
/// (A) Color:
/// Each card is red, green, or purple.
///
/// (B) Symbol:
/// Each card contains ovals, squiggles, or diamonds.
///
/// (C) Number:
/// Each card has one, two, or three symbols.
///
/// (D) Shading: Each card is solid, open, or striped.
///
/// A 'Set' consists of three cards in which each feature is EITHER the same on each card OR is
/// different on each card. That is to say, any feature in the 'Set' of three cards is either
/// common to all three cards or is different on each card.
